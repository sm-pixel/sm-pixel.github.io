        <p id="biotext">Hello! Iâ€™m Samantha Morrison and I currently live in Rock Hill, SC. I grew up outside of Chicago, Illinois. I
            love the weather down here but sometimes miss the cooler autumn and snow. I enjoy going to concerts,
            floating down the Catawba River, and hanging out with my 3 dogs.
        </p>

        <p id="biotext">Prior to the pandemic I had decided I wanted to make a career change. I wanted to be able to have a more
            family friendly schedule as well as logically solve problems. After enrolling in the boot camp I started
            teaching myself a few of the technologies we learned during the boot camp. This assisted me in reinforcing
            information as well as learning new and better ways to code.
        </p>
        <p id="biotext">I have a background in sales, management and cosmetology. Cosmetology allowed me to utilize the first two
            fields together as well as being able to satisfy clients needs. With an eclectic background I believe I had
            a lot to bring to the table.
        </p>
        <p id="biotext">Continuing learning has always been a priority of mine with every field I have worked in. Learning as much as
            I did through the boot camp I see myself continuing that within this field as well.
